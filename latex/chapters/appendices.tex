\chapter{Research Ethics Approval}\label{apx:ethics}

The research ethics approval process for the work described in this dissertation was completed in June 2023, before any work using data commenced. Due to the use of secondary data arising from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a self-declaration letter was deemed to be necessary and, when submitted, the application was allocated reference number: 055262. Formal approval of the self-declaration is evidenced here in \autoref{fig:ethicsapprov}.
